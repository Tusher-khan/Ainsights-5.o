- grouping: a measure broken down by a dimension.
- ranking: top/bottom N by a measure.
- comparison: two or more named entities or measures compared.

- percentage_analysis: shares, proportions, percentage change.
- statistical_analysis: distribution, correlation, spread, describe.
- visualization: the user explicitly asks for a chart.
- descriptive_analysis: an overview or summary of the data.
- recommendation: the user asks what to do, why something is happening, or for a suggestion/action, not just a number.
- dataset_question: about the dataset itself (size, freshness, what it covers).
- schema_question: about columns, types or structure.
